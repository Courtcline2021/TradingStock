This is an API based application. It pulls from NASDAQ and selecting a time period to pull stock information from. 
What I have done is break it down into calculating returns, moving averages and ploting the a chart to track the differences. 
This application can be used with sql to track the market and to store the information. 
*Quandl is having a issue. The API can not be pulled and limits what the program does. 
* Need to research why the API is not working properly.
